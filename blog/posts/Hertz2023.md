An individual can learn about someone else’s traits by accumulating experiences from the specific relationship and by incorporating group identity information. Here we examine how group identity affects learning about others and the social learning mechanisms underlying the persistence of intergroup bias. Participants played a game with four other bot-players that entailed collecting stars and could sacrifice a move to zap another player, who would then lose three turns. The bot-players' avatars were either the same or a different color than the participant's avatar. Over six experimental conditions, participants were exposed to different behavioral patterns of bot-players—either zappers or zap-avoiders. We found that participants adjusted their zapping behavior according to the bot-player's behavior and were more likely to zap zappers than avoiders. Participants were also more likely to zap outgroup players and less likely to zap ingroup players, regardless of the player’s behavior, indicating a persistent intergroup bias. Using a computational learning model, we identified the contribution of three learning mechanisms to this tendency. Prior beliefs about players' zapping behavior were higher for outgroup than for ingroup players. Learning rates were very low for outgroup players, making it very difficult to overcome prior beliefs, whereas learning rates for ingroup players were high. Finally, participants attributed the negative behavior of one outgroup player to all other outgroup players, making beliefs about outgroup players more homogeneous. Our results show how group identity shapes and confounds social learning and highlight how intergroup bias can persist despite interaction and experience.

一个人可以通过积累与特定关系的经验和融入群体身份信息来了解别人的特点。在这里，我们研究群体身份如何影响对他人的学习以及支持种族偏见持续存在的社会学习机制。参与者与四个其他机器玩家一起玩一个收集星星并可以牺牲移动来击中另一个玩家（然后该玩家将失去三次回合）的游戏。机器玩家的头像要么与参与者的头像相同，要么不同颜色。在六个实验条件下，参与者接触到不同行为模式的机器玩家——即打手或避开打手。我们发现，参与者根据机器玩家的行为调整自己击中其他人（zapping） 的行为，并更有可能攻击打手而非避开打手。无论是什么情况下，参与者都更有可能攻击外部组成员而不是内部组成员，并且很少攻击内部组成员，表明种族间偏见具有持续性质。使用计算学习模型，我们确定了三种学习机制对此倾向性产生贡献：关于球员 zapping 行为先前信念对外团队比内团队更高。对于外团队的学习率非常低，很难克服先前的信念，而内团队的学习率则较高。最后，参与者将一个外部组成员的负面行为归因于所有其他外部组成员，使得关于外部组成员的信仰更加同质化。我们的结果展示了群体身份如何塑造和混淆社会学习，并强调种族偏见如何在互动和经验中持续存在。
