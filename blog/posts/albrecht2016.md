The negative symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ) are associated with a pattern of reinforcement learning (RL) deficits likely related to degraded representations of reward values. However, the RL tasks used to date have required active responses to both reward and punishing stimuli. Pavlovian biases have been shown to affect performance on these tasks through invigoration of action to reward and inhibition of action to punishment, and may be partially responsible for the effects found in patients. Forty-five patients with schizophrenia and 30 demographically-matched controls completed a four-stimulus reinforcement learning task that crossed action (Go or NoGo) and the valence of the optimal outcome (reward or punishment-avoidance), such that all combinations of action and outcome valence were tested. Behaviour was modelled using a six-parameter RL model and EEG was simultaneously recorded. Patients demonstrated a reduction in Pavlovian performance bias that was evident in a reduced Go bias across the full group. In a subset of patients administered clozapine, the reduction in Pavlovian bias was enhanced. The reduction in Pavlovian bias in SZ patients was accompanied by feedback processing differences at the time of the P3a component. The reduced Pavlovian bias in patients is suggested to be due to reduced fidelity in the communication between striatal regions and frontal cortex. It may also partially account for previous findings of poorer Go-learning in schizophrenia where Go responses or Pavlovian consistent responses are required for optimal performance. An attenuated P3a component dynamic in patients is consistent with a view that deficits in operant learning are due to impairments in adaptively using feedback to update representations of stimulus value.

精神分裂症（SZ）的负性症状与一种弱化的奖励价值表征相关的强化学习（RL）缺陷模式有关。然而，迄今为止使用的RL任务需要对奖励和惩罚刺激做出积极反应。巴甫洛夫偏差已被证明会通过激发对奖励的行动和抑制对惩罚的行动来影响这些任务的表现，并且可能部分解释病人的影响。45名患有精神分裂症的患者和30名与之匹配的对照组完成了一个四刺激强化学习任务，该任务交叉了行动（Go或NoGo）和最佳结果的价值（奖励或惩罚-避免），以测试所有行动和结果价值的组合。使用六参数RL模型对行为进行建模，并同时记录脑电图（EEG）。患者表现出巴甫洛夫性能偏差的减少，这在全组中表现为Go偏差的减少。在接受氯氮平治疗的患者子集中，巴甫洛夫偏差的减少得到了增强。患者中巴甫洛夫偏差的减少伴随着P3a成分时的反馈处理差异。患者中巴甫洛夫性能偏差的降低被认为是由于纹状体区域和前额皮层之间通信的保真度降低。这也可能部分解释了以前发现的精神分裂症患者学习Go或巴甫洛夫一致反应时表现较差的情况。患者中P3a成分动态的减弱支持了一种观点，即操作性学习的缺陷是由于不能适应性地使用反馈来更新刺激价值表征而导致的。
